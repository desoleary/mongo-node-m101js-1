# What is npm?
npm is a NodeJS package manager which you can use it to install node programs. 
Additionally, you can use it in development to makes it easier to specify and manage dependencies.

# Installation
npm install express
npm install consolidate
npm install mongodb

# Alternative Installation Option
npm install
This command will look for the package.json file in the root of your project and install listed dependencies.
It tells npm how your package is structured, and what to do to install it.
Most of the time, you only need the "name", "version", and "main" fields (even for node-waf compiled addons).
If you don't know json, it is something you will be learning a lot more about through this course. 
It's pretty easy.
