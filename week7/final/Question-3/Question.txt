Question 3

In this problem you will update a document in the Enron dataset to illustrate your mastery of updating documents from the shell. 

Please add the email address "mrpotatohead@mongodb.com" to the list of addresses in the "headers.To" array for the document with "headers.Message-ID" of "<8147308.1075851042335.JavaMail.evans@thyme>" 

After you have completed that task, please download final3.zip from the Download Handout link and run final3-validate.js to get the validation code and put it in the box below without any extra spaces. The validation script assumes that it is connecting to a simple mongo instance on the standard port on localhost.

Running the query below validates that we are selecting the correct message (and only one).
> db.messages.find({"headers.Message-ID": "<8147308.1075851042335.JavaMail.evans@thyme>"}).pretty();


Running this update query will push the new address into the "To" array.
> db.messages.update({"headers.Message-ID": "<8147308.1075851042335.JavaMail.evans@thyme>"}, {$push: {"headers.To": "mrpotatohead@mongodb.com"}});
