Question 2

Please use the Enron dataset you imported for the previous problem. For this question you will use the aggregation framework to figure out pairs of people that tend to communicate a lot. To do this, you will need to unwind the To list for each message. 

This problem is a little tricky because a recipient may appear more than once in the To list for a message. You will need to fix that in a stage of the aggregation before doing your grouping and counting of (sender, recipient) pairs. 

db.messages.aggregate([
	{'$unwind': '$headers.To'},
	{'$group':
	  {
		_id: {'_id':'$-id', From: '$headers.From'},
		To: {$addToSet: '$headers.To'}
	  }
	},
	{'$unwind': '$To'},
	{'$group': 
		{
		 _id: {'From': '$_id.From', 'To': '$To'}
		 count: {'$sum': 1}
		}
	},
	{'$sort': {'count': -1}},
	{'$limit': 10}
	]);
